# Dual-Hand-Finger-Counter-using-MediaPipe
A real-time computer vision project that uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect both hands through a webcam and count the number of raised fingers. The system accurately tracks hand landmarks, identifies left and right hands, and displays individual as well as total finger counts on screen.
